# World-Happiness-Analysis
I organised and examined multiple datasets for world happiness report using Python. After that, I produced a report within Tableu.

## Objective
To carry out a thorough analysis of the World Happiness Report, looking at important metrics, and trends over time in order to pinpoint the variables affecting happiness levels globally and provide guidance for global well-being improvement initiatives.

## Key Questions
- How does GDP correlate with happiness?
- How do countries with similar GDPs differ in terms of happiness levels?
- Is there a correlation between GDPs per capita and life expectancy?
- Which countries regularly rank high or low in happiness across multiple years?
- Is there a relationship between trust in government and happiness score?
- How does a country's level of freedom compare to its happiness score?

## Data 
The project makes use of Words Happiness Report open-source datasets from kaggle.com. In order to answer the above questions.

## Tools
Dashboard made using Tableau public
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
- sklearn: for provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.
- KMeans: for using to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset
- pylab: for  importing functions from the modules Numpy and Matplotlib
